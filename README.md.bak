Solution is designed with Event-Driven architecture, this Worker Service will be consuming and producing events and follow a model of eventual consistency. 
When an underlying service is unavailable it would expect the requests to be processed once the service is back up and running 

We will be using Azure Service Bus to deliver events and messages.
